//Factory
//Rules
//All robots work
//Some robots rest (aka work in shifts)
//All robots get charged
//Some via remote charge
//Some via direct connetion
//After obsoletion:
//Some are recycled
//Some are destroyed
//At all times there are no more than 200 robots in the factory.

//Extra:
//Robot maintenance happens periodically and depends on the charger type
//If defective during check, terminate and make replacement
//Feel free to invent your own rules.

//Output
//The goal of this task is to write the data structure and user interface. No source code is required. Compilation is not a requirement.

//Eg.

//struct Employee
//{
//    unsigned int id;
//    std::string name;
//    unsigned short age;
//}

//class Company
//{
//    public:
//    std::string getName();
//    Employee oldest();
//    void printEmployees();

//    private:
//    std::string name;
//    std::vector<Employee>;
//}
